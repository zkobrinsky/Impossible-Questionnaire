# Impossible-Questionnaire

This is a Javascript frontend / Rails backend application where you can take and create questionnaires or surveys. There's a caveat though: if you try to select any answers that the creator doesn't want you to select, they will run away from you. The whole thing is a premise for a punch line. The only limit is your imagination.


## Requirements
Must have a loca postgres server running
This application is built on Rails 6.0.3.4.

## Installation
```bash
cd into "backend" and run:
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

## Usage
From backend:
```ruby
rails s
```

From frontend: 
Open index.html in browser. If you're having problems with CSS not loading, open it in incognito mode.
