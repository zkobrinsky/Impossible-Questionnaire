# Impossible-Questionnaire

This is a Javascript frontend / Rails backend application where you can take and create questionnaires or surveys. There's a caveat though: if you try to select any answers that the creator doesn't want you to select, they will run away from you. The whole thing is a premise for a punch line. The only limit is your imagination.
